Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy.  
Anki works by maintaining a database of flashcards that you can review.  
These deck are either your personal creation or one created by the <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/" target="_blank">community</a>.  
Creating a flashcard is a long and tedious task which involves a lot of repetitive tasks.  
youtube2anki is a Chrome extension that helps you with this process.  
Given a youtube video with available subtitles youtube2anki allows you to select a world or phrase, create a corresponding card and save it
to your database dodgeing a lot of repetitive tasks.
