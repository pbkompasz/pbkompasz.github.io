Anki is an open-source spaced-repetition program originally written in Python.
Third party software like Yomichan uses is a browser extension that communicates with a users data that can only be reached through the app.
A work around this limitation is an Anki add-on called anki-connect.
Anki-connect opens a HTTP server through which a users data can be accessed, but the downside of this is that the users needs to have Anki running on their computed.
With anki.js the communication happens via this package. No installation and running of other software is needed.
Anki.js can be packaged up with the browser extension without needing any extra maintenance from the final user.
